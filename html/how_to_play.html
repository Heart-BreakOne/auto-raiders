    <h1>SRHelper is a click emulator for the game Stream Raiders.</h1>
    <h2>Download for Google Chrome at the extension store <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/srhelper/flgahoglenmjoegheodkhahipokcilal">here</a></h2>
    <label></label><br>
    <div class="container">
        To get started, load the game after installing the extension and click on the extension icon on the extensions
        tab. That will open the SRHelper popup screen.<br>The popup has several settings to tailor the gameplay to
        your
        needs. Some of them are mandatory such as which units are allowed to be placed.<br>
        Below is the explanation of all the extension settings and how they work:
    </div><br>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <td>Reloader</td>
            <td>Due to memory and caching, the game eventually becomes unstable and unresponsive until the tab unrecoverably crashes. To mitigate this effect, set a period in minutes for the website's page to automatically refresh so the game is cleared from memory. Default is 60 minutes.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>UPDATE MAP!!</td>
            <td>If are you playing with loyalty preservation ON you will see the warning "UPDATE MAP!!" on the top header of the game whenever there's a game update. Go to the extension icon and click Update Maps, follow the instructions there to update the maps. If you are not preserving loyalty this warning can be ignored, after updating the map the warning goes away after the first loyalty battle.</td>

                it will randomly select one, if this option is enabled it won't select a random captain if a loyalty/favorite
