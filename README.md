This extension runs on the client side simulating user inputs so there's no risk of having you're account banned due to botting.


The desktop version of the game uses canvas, the mobile version is built differently, this extension is built to work with the mobile version, to use it open the devtools tab and select mobile mode.<br>
As an alternative to mobile mode via the devtools, there are browser extensions that force mobile mode.<br>
After installation, just open the game website and stay at the main menu.

#### What it does:
⚙️ Set your preferences on the extension's tab.<br>
🛑 Switch idling captains (allows playing with offline captains) and fills open slots with your loyalty and favorite captains<br>
⏸️ Pause individual slots to manually manage them<br>
💎 Skip loyalty chests if your loyalty is not diamond<br>
💰 Collects rewards, quests, battlepass, free daily rewards.<br>
☠️ Savages defeat chests.<br>
📜 Buy scrolls at your own discretion<br>
🗡️🛡️ Set what unit rarity types you would like to use<br>
🎯 Set priority for specific units you would like to use and not use<br>
☝️ Set how many units to place<br>
⚔️ Opens battlefield.<br>
⚗️ Use potions at you're own discretion<br>
✌️ Seeks a valid marker: vibe markers, set markers and maps without markers.<br>
🫡 Selects the first available unit from the ALL list ordered by readiness or level (manually select your personal preference).<br>
🚫 If the marker is invalid, outside the ally area or if there's another ally unit on the marker, it will seek another valid marker.<br>
🛠️ Handles situations in which the loading screen or the game freeze, any warnings or errors pop-ups appear or the battle starts while trying to place a unit.<br>
🟥🟪🟨 Visual indicators for when the captain switches modes to campaign, for when there aren't any units available to be placed and for when a loyalty chest battle is being skipped<br><br>
