## Click emulator for SR - Google Chrome extension.

### Special thanks to contributor:

This extension runs on the client side simulating user inputs so there's no risk of having you're account banned due to botting.

To use it you need to download this repo as a zip file, open the Google Chrome extension manager, enable dev mode and load an unpacked extension, select the zip file.<br>
The desktop version of the game uses canvas, the mobile version is built differently, this extension is built to work with the mobile version, to use it open the devtools tab and select mobile mode. Because of this it can be used on mobile chromium based browsers such as, but not limited to Kiwi.<br>
As an alternative to mobile mode via the devtools, there are browser extensions that force mobile mode.<br>
After installation, just open the game website and stay at the main menu.

#### What it does:
⚙️ Set your preferences on the extension's tab.
💰 Collects rewards.<br>
☠️ Savages defeat chests.<br>
📜 When the scroll store becomes available it buys scrolls within the first five minutes, if you're past 1hour and 30 minutes of the store refresh, buy manually. It will also refresh the store once for 100 coins. Check below to disable this feature<br>
📦 Collects quests, Quests tab only. Does not collect battle pass nor any freebies from the store. Check below to disable this feature<br><br>
⚔️ Opens battlefield.<br>
✌️ Seeks a valid marker: vibe markers, set markers and maps without markers.<br>
🫡 Selects the first available unit from the ALL list ordered by readiness or level (manually select your personal preference).<br>
☝️ Places only one unit on dungeons as keys only increase with battle quantity and more units placed increase the death toll as the levels get high hitting a point where all units are dead while the dungeon is still running <br>
🚫 If the marker is invalid, outside the ally area or if there's another ally unit on the marker, it will seek another valid marker.<br>
🛠️ Handles situations in which the loading screen or the game freeze, any warnings or errors pop-ups appear or the battle starts while trying to place a unit.<br>

## Customize to your liking
